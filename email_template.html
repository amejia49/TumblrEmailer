    <p>
      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
      my time.

    <p>
      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
      Check out my new posts here: 
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
    </p>

      Talk soon,<br>
